<p><b>7.5.2</b> In the last reporting period,<a href="#_ftn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[4]</a> what was the mean reaction and escalation response time in the event the red team exercise activities were discovered? (value and time unit, not mature enough to measure, no blue team)&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7.5.2.1</b>&nbsp;Please enter a value and time unit. (Numeric/Drop-down (Hours, days, weeks, months, years)</p>
<p><b>7.6 Threat Modeling</b></p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (the Blue Team) in an operational environment. Also known as Cyber Red Team. (Source: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/red_team" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NIST Glossary</a>)</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a> Full details mean that the agency may request any and all technical details of a given security assessment. Partial details would be considered reports that exclude details due to unique contractual relationships (e.g., certain information is subject to intellectual property protections or implied limitations that prevent full disclosure of operations).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[3]</a> “Blue Team” refers to a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on its findings and expertise, the Blue Team provides recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cybersecurity readiness posture. Often, a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team deployment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems.
