FY23 CIO Q3- Section 7a - Ground Truth Testing- Testing Activities</p>
<p><b>DETAILS:</b></p>
<h2><a name="GroundTruthTesting"></a>Ground Truth Testing</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to start evaluating how agency testing procedures are currently established, conducted, and performed. Ground truth testing looks to go beyond the assumption that generic vulnerability scanning tools are sufficient for testing system security. Additionally, this section is intended to baseline how well the organization internally communicates the effectiveness of its security testing.</p>
<p><b>7.1</b> Please fill out the following tables providing the cumulative testing activities over the current fiscal year to date.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[31]</a> A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (the Blue Team) in an operational environment. Also known as Cyber Red Team. (Source: <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/red_team" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">NIST Glossary</a>)</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[32]</a> Full details mean that the agency may request any and all technical details of a given security assessment. Partial details would be considered reports that exclude details due to unique contractual relationships (e.g., certain information is subject to intellectual property protections or implied limitations that prevent full disclosure of operations).</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[33]</a> “Blue Team” refers to a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on its findings and expertise, the Blue Team provides recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cybersecurity readiness posture. Often, a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team deployment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems.

<p><a href="#_ftnref9" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[34]</a> A form of risk assessment that models aspects of the attack and defense sides of a logical entity, such as a piece of data, an application, a host, a system, or an environment.
