<p><b>Bolded metrics&nbsp; are 'Core Metrics'</b></p>

<p><em>Italicized metrics are 'Required Supplemental'</em></p>

<p><em>26. To what extent have the roles and responsibilities of identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) stakeholders been defined, communicated, and implemented across the agency, and appropriately resourced (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-1, IA-1, IA-2, PL-4, and PS-1; NIST SP 800-63-3; NIST SP 800-63A, B, and C; OMB M-19-17; Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) playbooks and guidance; HSPD 12)?</em></p>

<p><em>27. To what degree does the organization utilize a comprehensive ICAM policy, strategy, process, and technology solution roadmap to guide its ICAM processes and activities (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-1 and IA-1; NIST SP 800-207; NIST CSF: PR.AC-4 and PR.AC-5; OMB M-19-17; OMB M-22-09; DHS ED 19-01; FICAM; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Controls 5 and 6)?</em></p>

<p>28. To what extent has the organization developed and implemented processes for assigning position risk designations and performing appropriate personnel screening prior to granting access to its systems (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): PS-2 and PS-3; NIST CSF: PR.IP11; OMB M-19-17; National Insider Threat Policy; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 7.4.3)?</p>

<p><em>29.&nbsp; To what extent does the organization ensure that access agreements, including nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements, and rules of behavior, as appropriate, for individuals (both privileged and non-privileged users) that access its systems are completed and maintained (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-8, AC21, CA-3, PL-4, and PS-6)?</em></p>

<p><b>30. To what extent has the organization implemented phishing-resistant multifactor authentication mechanisms (e.g., PIV, FIDO2, or web authentication) for non-privileged users to access the organization's facilities <span class="error">[organization-defined entry/exit points]</span>, networks, and systems, including for remote access (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-17, IA-2, IA-5, IA-8, and PE-3; NIST SP 800-63; NIST SP 800-128; NIST SP 800-157; NIST SP 800-207: Tenet 6; NIST CSF: PR.AC-1 and PR.AC-6; NIST Security Measures for EOCritical Software Use: SM 1.1; FIPS 201-2; HSPD-12; OMB M-19-17; OMB M-22-09; OMB M-23-03; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Control 6; CISA Capacity Enhancement Guide; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 2.3, 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.4, 2.9, 2.10, and 2.10.2)?</b></p>

<p><b>31.&nbsp; To what extent has the organization implemented phishing-resistant multifactor authentication mechanisms (e.g., PIV, FIDO2, or web authentication) for privileged users to access the organization's facilities <span class="error">[organization-defined entry/exit points]</span>, networks, and systems, including for remote access (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-17 and PE-3; NIST SP 800-63; NIST SP 800-128; NIST SP 800-157; NIST SP 800-207: Tenet 6; NIST CSF: PR.AC-1 and PR.AC-6; NIST Security Measures for EOCritical Software Use: SM 1.1; FIPS 201-2; HSPD-12; OMB M-19-17; OMB M-22-09; OMB M-23-03; DHS ED 19-01; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Control 6; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 2.3, 2.4, 2.9, and 2.10)?</b></p>

<p><b>32.&nbsp; To what extent does the organization ensure that privileged accounts are provisioned, managed, and reviewed in accordance with the principles of least privilege and separation of duties? Specifically, this includes processes for periodic review and adjustment of privileged user accounts and permissions, inventorying and validating the scope and number of privileged accounts, and ensuring that privileged user account activities are logged and periodically reviewed (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-1, AC-2, AC-5, AC-6, AC-17, AU-2, AU-3, AU-6, and IA-4; NIST CSF PR.AC-4; NIST Security Measures for EOCritical Software Use: SM 2.2; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 3.1; OMB M-19-17; OMB M-21-31; DHS ED 19-01; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Controls 5, 6, and 8)?</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>33. To what extent does the organization ensure that appropriate configuration/connection requirements are maintained for remote access connections? This includes the use of appropriate cryptographic modules, system time-outs, and the monitoring and control of remote access sessions (NIST SP 800-46 (Rev. 2); NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AC-11, AC12, AC-17, AC-19, AU-2, IA-7, SC-10, SC-13, and SI-4; NIST CSF: PR.AC-3; OMB M-22-09).</em></p>

<p>34. Provide any additional information on the effectiveness (positive or negative) of the organizationâ€™s identity and access management program that was not noted in the questions above. Taking into consideration the maturity level generated from the questions above and based on all testing performed, is the identity and access management program effective?</p>
