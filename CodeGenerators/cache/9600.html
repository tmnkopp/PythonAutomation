<p><b>Bolded&nbsp; metrics are 'Core Metrics'</b></p>

<p><em>Italicized metrics are 'Required Supplemental'</em></p>

<p><em>35. To what extent has the organization developed a privacy program for the protection of personally identifiable information (PII) that is collected, used, maintained, shared, and disposed of by information systems (NIST SP 800-37 (Rev. 2): Section 2.3 and Task P-1; NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CA-2, RA-3, RA-8, SA8(33), PM-5(1), PM-20, PM-27, PT-5, PT-6, and SI-12(1); NIST SP 800-122; NIST CSF: ID.GV-3; NIST Privacy Framework; OMB M-19-03; OMB M-20-04; OMB A-130: Appendix I; FY 2022 SAOP FISMA Metrics: Sections 1, 4, and 5(b))?</em></p>

<p><b>36. To what extent has the organization implemented the following security controls to protect its PII and other agency sensitive data, as appropriate, throughout the data lifecycle. (NIST SP 800-37 (Rev. 2); NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): SC-8, SC-28, MP-3, MP-6, and SI-12(3); NIST SP 800-207; NIST CSF: PR.DS-1, PR.DS-2, PR.PT-2, and PR.IP-6; NIST Security Measures for EO-Critical Software Use: SM 2.3 and SM 2.4; OMB M-22-09; DHS BOD 18-02; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 2.1, 2.1.1 and 2.2; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Control 3)?</b></p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Encryption of data at rest</b></li>
	<li><b>Encryption of data in transit</b></li>
	<li><b>Limitation of transfer to removable media</b></li>
	<li><b>Sanitization of digital media prior to disposal or reuse</b></li>
</ul>


<p><b>37. To what extent has the organization implemented security controls (e.g., EDR) to prevent data exfiltration and enhance network defenses? (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): SI-3, SI-7(8), SI4(4)(18), SC-7(10), and SC-18; NIST CSF: PR.DS-5; NIST Security Measures for EO-Critical Software Use: SM 4.3; OMB M-21-07; OMB M-22-01; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Controls 9 and 10; DHS BOD 18-01; DHS ED 19-01)?</b></p>

<p>38. To what extent has the organization developed and implemented a Data Breach Response Plan, as appropriate, to respond to privacy events? (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): IR-8 and IR-8(1); NIST SP 800-122; OMB M-17-12; OMB M-23-03; FY 2022 SAOP FISMA Metrics: Section 12)?</p>

<p>39. To what extent does the organization ensure that privacy awareness training is provided to all individuals, including role-based privacy training? (Note: Privacy awareness training topics should include, as appropriate: responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and EGovernment Act of 2002, consequences for failing to carry out responsibilities, identifying privacy risks, mitigating privacy risks, and reporting privacy incidents, data collections and use requirements) (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, and PL-4; FY 2022 SAOP FISMA Metrics: Section 9, 10, and 11)</p>

<p>40. Provide any additional information on the effectiveness (positive or negative) of the organizationâ€™s data protection and privacy program that was not noted in the questions above. Taking into consideration the maturity level generated from the questions above and based on all testing performed, is the data protection and privacy program effective?</p>
