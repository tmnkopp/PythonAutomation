<p><b>WHERE:</b><br>
 FY22 Q2- Section 8 - Smart Patching</p>
<p><b>DETAILS:</b></p>
<h2><a name="SmartPatching"></a>Smart Patching</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is to evaluate how well the agency is prioritizing and applying patches within the enterprise. Operations can be impacted by software patches that create unintended consequences to interoperability. However, unpatched systems can leave vulnerabilities exposed that can be exploited by adversaries. Balancing stability with an up-to-date security posture is a critical measure of whether organizations are taking vulnerability management seriously.</p>
<p><b>8.1</b> Does your agency have a centralized<a href="#_ftn1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> patch management process? (yes/no)</p>
<p><b>8.1.1 If no, does your agency set standards for a patch management process? (yes/no)</b></p>
<p><b>8.1.2</b> Does the agency patching management process utilize the severity of a vulnerability (e.g. CVSS) to prioritize patches? (yes/no)</p>
<p><b>8.1.3</b> Does your agency use methods other than CVSS to analyze the severity of vulnerabilities? (yes/no – if yes, state which methods)</p>
<p><b>8.1.3.1-</b> Text Box displays if 'Yes' is selected</p>
<p><b>8.1.4</b> Describe the extent to which the agency applies threat intelligence in its patching process. (Text Box)</p>
<p><b>8.2</b> Does your patching prioritization process leverage significant automation?<a href="#_ftn2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a> (yes/no)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>8.2.1 If yes, what percentage of software assets are covered by automation? (Percentage)</b></p>
<p><b>8.3</b> What elements of the <a href="https://www.nist.gov/publications/system-development-life-cycle-sdlc" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</a> contribute to significantly reducing the timeliness of your patching processes (e.g., patches are bundled with other change requests and subsequently require lengthy review processes)?</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[1]</a> “Centralized” in this context means that the cybersecurity program is coordinating necessary security patches and tracking the efforts in a single centralized location. For agencies with components (e.g., bureaus, operating divisions, components, etc.) that manage patch processes independently, this would not be considered as centralized.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[2]</a> Patch prioritization calculation requires no manual input beyond initial set up and recalibration of factors</p>
<p><b>CONDITIONAL METRICS:</b></p>
<p>If 8.1 is no, the&nbsp; 8.1.1 is required&nbsp;</p>
<p>If 8.1.3 is yes, then 8.1.3.1 is required&nbsp;</p>
<p>If 8.2 is yes, then 8.2.1 is required</p>
