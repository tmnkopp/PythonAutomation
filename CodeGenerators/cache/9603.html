<p>52. To what extent does the organization use an incident response plan to provide a formal, focused, and coordinated approach to responding to incidents (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): IR-8; NIST SP 800-61 (Rev. 2): Section 2.3.2; NIST CSF: RS.RP1; Presidential Policy Directive (PPD) 8 – National Preparedness; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 10.1.1; FY 2022 CIO FISMA Metrics: 10.6)?</p>

<p>53. To what extent have incident response team structures/models, stakeholders, and their roles, responsibilities, levels of authority, and dependencies been defined, communicated, and implemented across the organization (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5) IR-7; NIST SP 800-61 (Rev. 2); NIST SP 800-83; NIST CSF: RS.CO1; OMB M-20-04; US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines; Green Book: Principles 3, 4, and 5)?</p>

<p>56. To what extent does the organization ensure that incident response information is shared with individuals with significant security responsibilities and reported to external stakeholders in a timely manner (FISMA; NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): IR-6; NIST CSF: RS.CO2 through RS.CO-5; OMB M-20-04; US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines; PPD-41; DHS Cyber Incident Reporting Unified Message)?</p>

<p><em>57. To what extent does the organization collaborate with stakeholders to ensure on-site, technical assistance/surge capabilities can be leveraged for quickly responding to incidents, including through contracts/agreements, as appropriate, for incident response support (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): IR-4; NIST SP 800-86; OMB M-20-04; PPD-41; NCPS Cloud Interface Reference Architecture)?</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>58. To what extent does the organization use the following technology to support its incident response program (NIST SP 800-44; NIST SP 800-61 (Rev. 2); NIST SP 800-137; OMB M-22-01; OMB M-22-09)?</em></p>

<p><em>•Web application protections, such as web application firewalls</em></p>

<p><em>•Event and incident management, such as intrusion detection and prevention tools, and incident tracking and reporting tools</em></p>

<p><em>•Aggregation and analysis, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products</em></p>

<p><em>•Malware detection, such as antivirus and antispam software technologies</em></p>

<p><em>•Information management, such as data loss prevention</em></p>

<p><em>•File integrity and endpoint and server security tools</em></p>

<p>59.1 Please provide the assessed maturity level for the agency's Respond - Incident Response function.</p>

<p>59.2 Provide any additional information on the effectiveness (positive or negative) of the organization’s incident response program that was not noted in the questions above. Taking into consideration the maturity level generated from the questions above and based on all testing performed, is the incident response program effective?</p>
