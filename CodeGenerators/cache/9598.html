<p>Section 2A Configuration Management (Protect)</p>
<p>17. To what extent have the roles and responsibilities of configuration management stakeholders been defined, communicated, and implemented across the agency, and appropriately resourced (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-1; NIST SP 800-128: Section 2.4; Green Book: Principles 3, 4, and 5)?</p>
<p>18. To what extent does the organization use an enterprise wide configuration management plan that includes, at a minimum, the following components: roles and responsibilities, including establishment of a Change Control Board (CCB) or related body; configuration management processes, including processes for: identifying and managing configuration items during the appropriate phase within an organization’s SDLC; configuration monitoring; and applying configuration management requirements to contractor operated systems (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-9; NIST SP 800-128: Section 2.3.2)?</p>
<p><em>19. To what extent does the organization utilize baseline configurations for its information systems and maintain inventories of related components at a level of granularity necessary for tracking and reporting&nbsp; (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-2 and CM-8; NIST CSF: DE.CM-7 and PR.IP-1; BOD 23-01; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Control 4)?</em></p>
<p><b>20. To what extent does the organization use configuration settings/common secure configurations for its information systems (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-6, CM-7, RA-5, and SI-2; NIST SP 800-70 (Rev. 4); NIST CSF: ID.RA-1 and DE.CM-8; NIST Security Measures for EOCritical Software Use: SM 3.3; OMB M-22-09; OMB M-23-03; BOD 23-01; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Controls 4 and 7; CISA Cybersecurity Incident Response Playbooks)?</b></p>
<p><b>21. &nbsp;To what extent does the organization use flaw remediation processes, including asset discovery, vulnerability scanning, analysis, and patch management, to manage software vulnerabilities on all network addressable IP-assets (NIST SP 800-40 (Rev. 4); NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-3, RA-5, SI-2, and SI-3; NIST SP 800-207: Section 2.1; NIST CSF: ID.RA-1; NIST Security Measures for EOCritical Software Use: SM 3.2; OMB M-22-09; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 1.4, 8.1 and 8.2; CIS Top 18 Security Controls: Controls 4 and 7; BOD 18-02; BOD 19-02; BOD 22-01; BOD 23-01; BOD 23-01 Implementation Guidance; CISA Cybersecurity Incident Response Playbooks)?</b></p>
<p><em>22. To what extent has the organization adopted the Trusted Internet Connection (TIC) 3.0 program to assist in protecting its network (NIST SP 800-207; OMB M-19-26; DHS-CISA TIC 3.0 Core Guidance Documents; NCPS Cloud Interface Reference Architecture)?</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>23. To what extent has the organization defined and implemented configuration change control activities including: determination of the types of changes that are configuration controlled; review and approval/disapproval of proposed changes with explicit consideration of security impacts and security classification of the system; documentation of configuration change decisions; implementation of approved configuration changes; retaining records of implemented changes; auditing and review of configuration changes; and coordination and oversight of changes by the CCB, as appropriate (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): CM-2, CM-3, and CM-4; NIST CSF: PR.IP-3)?</p>
<p><em>24. To what degree does the organization utilize a vulnerability disclosure policy (VDP) as part of its vulnerability management program for internet-accessible federal systems (NIST SP 800-53 (Rev. 5): RA-5(11); OMB M-20-32; DHS BOD 20-01; FY 2023 CIO FISMA Metrics: 9.1, 9.2, and 9.3)?</em></p>
<p>25.1 Please provide the assessed maturity level for the agency's Protect - Configuration Management program.</p>
<p>25.2 Provide any additional information on the effectiveness (positive or negative) of the organization’s configuration management program that was not noted in the questions above. Taking into consideration the maturity level generated from the questions above and based on all testing performed, is the configuration management program effective?</p>
