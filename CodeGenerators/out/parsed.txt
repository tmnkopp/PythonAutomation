 The organization has 
not defined 
policies, 
procedures, and 

processes for using 
standard data 
elements/taxonomy 

to develop and 

maintain an up
-to-date inventory of 
software assets and 
licenses, including for
 EO-
critical software 
and
 mobile 
applications, u
sed in 
the organization's 
environmen
t with the 
detailed information 
necessary for tracking 
and reporting.
 The organization has 
defined policies, 

procedures, and 

processes for using 
standard data 
elements/taxonomy 

to develop and 

maintain an up
-to-date inventory of 
software assets and 
licenses
, including for 
EO-
critical software 
and 
mobile 
applications, u
sed in 
the organization's 
environment with 

the detailed 
information 
necessary for 

tracking and 

reporting.
 The organization consistently 
us
es its standard data 

elements/taxonomy to 

develop and maintain an up
-to-date inventory of software 
assets and licenses, including 
for
 EO-
critical software and
 mobile applications, u
sed in 
the organization's 
environment and uses this 
taxonomy to inform which 

assets can/cannot be 

introduced into the network.
  
Th
e organization establishes 

and maintains a software 

inventory for all platforms 
running EO
-critical software 
and all software (both EO
-critical and non
-EO-
critical) 
deployed to each platform.
 The organization ensures 
that the software assets, 

including 
EO-
critical 
software and mobile 
applications as appropriate, 
on the network (and their 

associated licenses), are 

covered by an organization
-wide software asset 
management (or Mobile 
Device Manage
ment) 
capability and are subject to 

the monitoring processes 
defined within the 
organization's ISCM 

strategy.
  For mobile devices, the 
agency enforces the 

capability to prevent the 

execution of unauthorized 
software (e.g., blacklist, 
whitelist, or cryptogr
aphic
 containerization).
 
 The organization 
employs automation to 

track the life cycle of 

the organization's 
software assets (and 
their associated 

licenses), including for 

EO-
critical software and 
mobile applications, 
with processes that 
limit the 

manual/pr
ocedural 
methods for asset 
management. Further, 
software inventories 

are regularly updated as 

part of the 
organizationâ„¢s 
enterprise architecture 

current and future 

states.
