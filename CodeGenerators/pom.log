The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (the Blue Team) in an operational environment. Also known as Cyber Red Team. (Source: NIST Glossary)
06/01/2023 09:46:08 AM text: [2] Full details mean that the agency may request any and all technical details of a given security assessment. Partial details would be considered reports that exclude details due to unique contractual relationships (e.g., certain information is subject to intellectual property protections or implied limitations that prevent full disclosure of operations).
06/01/2023 09:46:08 AM text: [3] “Blue Team” refers to a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on its findings and expertise, the Blue Team provides recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cybersecurity readiness posture. Often, a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team deployment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems.

06/01/2023 09:51:49 AM text: [1] A group of people authorized and organized to emulate a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture. The Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cybersecurity by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by demonstrating what works for the defenders (the Blue Team) in an operational environment. Also known as Cyber Red Team. (Source: NIST Glossary)
06/01/2023 09:51:49 AM text: [2] Full details mean that the agency may request any and all technical details of a given security assessment. Partial details would be considered reports that exclude details due to unique contractual relationships (e.g., certain information is subject to intellectual property protections or implied limitations that prevent full disclosure of operations).
06/01/2023 09:51:49 AM text: [3] “Blue Team” refers to a group of individuals that conduct operational network vulnerability evaluations and provide mitigation techniques to customers who have a need for an independent technical review of their network security posture. The Blue Team identifies security threats and risks in the operating environment, and in cooperation with the customer, analyzes the network environment and its current state of security readiness. Based on its findings and expertise, the Blue Team provides recommendations that integrate into an overall community security solution to increase the customer's cybersecurity readiness posture. Often, a Blue Team is employed by itself or prior to a Red Team deployment to ensure that the customer's networks are as secure as possible before having the Red Team test the systems.

06/01/2023 09:51:49 AM text: DETAILS:
06/01/2023 09:51:49 AM text: The purpose of this section is to evaluate how well the agency is prioritizing and applying patches within the enterprise. Operations can be impacted by software patches that create unintended consequences to interoperability. However, unpatched systems can leave vulnerabilities exposed that can be exploited by adversaries. Balancing stability with an up-to-date security posture is a critical measure of whether organizations are taking vulnerability management seriously.
